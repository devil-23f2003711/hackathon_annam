# 🌱 Soil Classification Hackathon

Welcome to the **Soil Classification Hackathon Repository** — a two-part machine learning challenge focused on predicting soil types using structured data and AI modeling techniques.

This repository contains all code, data processing scripts, notebooks, and supporting documentation needed to explore and solve both classification tasks.

## 📌 Challenges Overview

### 🔹 Challenge 1 – `soil-classification-1`
- Aimed at building a baseline model for soil type prediction.
- Includes one primary notebook: `soil-classification-1.ipynb`
- Architecture diagram and references provided under `docs/`.

### 🔹 Challenge 2 – `soil-classification-2`
- Builds upon Challenge 1 with extended objectives or new datasets.
- Primary notebook: `soil-classification-2.ipynb`
- Same structured support as Challenge 1.
